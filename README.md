# R06 Drug Sales Time Series Forecasts
## About

The classification code R06 refers to antihistamines for systemic use, including well-known medications like Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra. These drugs are essential for managing allergy symptoms such as sneezing and itchy eyes. As someone who deals with seasonal allergies myself, I wanted to forecast sales for these R06 medications. The goal was to predict sales in order to help companies make informed decisions, reduce risks, and better meet customer needs.
