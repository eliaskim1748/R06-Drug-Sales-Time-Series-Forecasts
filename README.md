# R06 Drug Sales Time Series Forecasts
## About

The classification code R06 refers to antihistamines for systemic use, including well-known medications like Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra. These drugs are essential for managing allergy symptoms such as sneezing and itchy eyes. As someone who deals with seasonal allergies myself, I wanted to forecast sales for these R06 medications. To do this, I investigated various forecasting methods to identify patterns and trends in their usage.
